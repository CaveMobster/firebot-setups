# Queue command

This setup adds a queue command that works with subcommands.

## (Sub)commands

**!queue** - command that users can use to enter the queue.

**!queue start** - Clears the file and opens the queue.

**!queue leave** - Leave the queue, removes username from the list.

**!queue close** - Closes the queue to prevent users from entering.

**!queue open** - Opens the queue without clearing the file.

**!queue draw** - Draws the next person in line from the file.

**!queue clear** - Clears the file.

**!queue [anything]** - Is a fallback command with which the user can enter the queue with a custom message.
